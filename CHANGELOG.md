## [Unreleased]

### Added
- M0 scaffold: Cargo workspace with 12 crates, dual `MIT OR Apache-2.0` licensing,
  `cargo-deny` license gate, CI matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows), and the design record
  under `docs/design/` and `docs/decisions/`.
- M1 xAI client (`grokforge-xai`): typed `POST /v1/responses` request model, SSE streaming
  via `eventsource-stream` with frame reassembly across TCP reads, typed events (text and
  reasoning deltas, whole-chunk tool calls with a partial-JSON accumulation hedge, usage with
  cached/reasoning-token breakdown), error taxonomy with initial-request retry/backoff
  (honoring `Retry-After`), `GET /v1/models` validation, and request byte-accounting for
  ledger reconciliation. Byte-controllable mock SSE server in `grokforge-test-support`; hidden
  `grokforge debug api` live smoke command.
- M2 agent core (`grokforge-core`, `grokforge-protocol`, `grokforge-sandbox`): the full
  headless agent loop. Protocol vocabulary (Op/Event, approvals, SandboxPolicy, ledger,
  items). Turn state machine (assemble → stream → run tools → loop). Built-in tools
  (read_file, write_file, edit, shell, list, glob, grep) behind a unified `Tool` trait, run
  through a `SandboxRunner` seam (passthrough backend; OS-native enforcement lands at M5).
  Pure 4×3 approval decision table (all 12 cells tested) with a deny-and-continue headless
  approver. Secret redaction at ingress + secrets.deny blocked-glob reads. Context assembler
  as the single ledger choke point, byte-reconciled with the serialized request. Append-only
  JSONL rollout persistence with size-capped debug-log rotation math. Working
  `grokforge exec -p` headless command (`--preset`, `--allow`, `--json`, `--model`,
  `--effort`, `--cd`) with CI-friendly exit codes.
- M3 (first cut) interactive TUI (`grokforge-tui`): a working ratatui frontend driving the
  agent over the same event/approval channels as headless. Async event loop (crossterm
  `EventStream` + agent events + approval requests in `tokio::select!`), scrolling transcript
  with role-styled entries and live streaming, composer, status line, and an interactive
  approval modal (`y`/`a`/`d`). `TestBackend` render tests. Launched by the default,
  no-subcommand `grokforge` invocation. (Uses the alternate screen; the inline-viewport +
  native-scrollback render pipeline from the design docs is the planned upgrade.)
- M5 OS-native sandbox (`grokforge-sandbox`): real kernel-enforced backends replacing the
  passthrough placeholder. macOS Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec` with a generated, param-passed SBPL
  profile — canonicalized paths, injection-guarded) confines writes to the workspace, keeps
  `.git` read-only, and denies network in workspace-write mode. Linux bubblewrap (`bwrap`
  shell-out: read-only root, workspace bind-mounted, network namespace unshared). Denial
  classifier (distinguishes sandbox blocks from real failures). `default_runner()` factory
  selects per platform and reports capability honestly (`enforced` flag). Wired into both
  frontends. Verified end-to-end: under `--preset auto` the model's write outside the
  workspace is blocked by the kernel.
